        <p>Welcome to WayloStream. <br />
        
        A new streaming music website. <br />
        
        Users buy credits to stream music. <br />
        
        Repeated streams converts to ownership. <br />
        
        The artist puts a price on a stream and ownership. <br />
        
        Say 1 cent per stream and 100 streams is ownership. <br />
        
        Ownership allows user to download or stream forever. <br />
        
        Artist controls price of stream and ownership. <br />
        
        Better metadata so composers, engineers etc are searchable. <br />
        
        A fair way to check out new music and compensate artists. <br />
        
        Give artists the opportunity to put a price on streaming music. <br />
        
        An alternative to the idea that music is FREE. <br />
